        <p> I cannot stress enough how good this show is. I've watched a lot of TV in my life and this show still remains the best show I've ever seen. </p>
        <p> Breaking Bad is absolutely, without a doubt, one of the greatest tv shows ever created...it's damn near perfect! </p>
        <p> I have never watched a show that is as consistently genuine and engaging as Breaking Bad. This is undoubtedly one of the greatest shows ever, and it consistently improves as it progresses. </p>
