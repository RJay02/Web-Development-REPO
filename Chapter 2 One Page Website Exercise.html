        <h2> Key Information</h2>
        <p>
            Set in Albuquerque, New Mexico, between 2008 and 2010,[7] Breaking Bad follows Walter White, 
            a modest high school chemistry teacher who transforms into a ruthless kingpin in the local methamphetamine drug trade, 
            driven to financially provide for his family after being diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer. 
            Initially making only small batches of meth with his former student Jesse Pinkman in a rolling meth lab, 
            Walter and Jesse eventually expand to make larger batches of special blue meth that is incredibly pure and creates high demand. 
            Walter takes on the name "Heisenberg" to mask his identity. Because of his drug-related activities, 
            Walter eventually finds himself at odds with his family, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) through his brother-in-law Hank Schrader, 
            the local gangs, and the Mexican drug cartels (including their regional distributors), putting him and his family's lives at risk.
