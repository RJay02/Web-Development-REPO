        <h2> Key Information</h2>
        <p>
            Set in Albuquerque, New Mexico, between 2008 and 2010,[7] Breaking Bad follows Walter White, 
            a modest high school chemistry teacher who transforms into a ruthless kingpin in the local methamphetamine drug trade, 
            driven to financially provide for his family after being diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer. 
            Initially making only small batches of meth with his former student Jesse Pinkman in a rolling meth lab, 
            Walter and Jesse eventually expand to make larger batches of special blue meth that is incredibly pure and creates high demand. 
            Walter takes on the name "Heisenberg" to mask his identity. Because of his drug-related activities, 
            Walter eventually finds himself at odds with his family, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) through his brother-in-law Hank Schrader, 
            the local gangs, and the Mexican drug cartels (including their regional distributors), putting him and his family's lives at risk.

        <h2> Cast / Main Characters: </h2>

        <ul> 
            <li> Bryan Cranston as Walter White, a high-school chemistry teacher who, shortly after his 50th birthday,
                 is diagnosed with Stage III lung cancer and turns to making meth to secure his family's finances. As his shady business progresses, 
                 Walter gains a notorious reputation under the alias of "Heisenberg".
            </li>     


            <li> Anna Gunn as Skyler White, Walter's wife who was pregnant with their second child before his diagnosis and 
                who becomes increasingly suspicious of her husband after he begins behaving in unfamiliar ways. 
                Gunn sees Skyler as "grounded, tough, smart and driven". Gunn sees Skyler's stalled writing career as her biggest dream, saying, 
                "I think she really deep down yearns to be an artist and to be creative and productive."
            </li>    


            <li> Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman, Walter's cooking partner and former student. Paul sees Jesse as a funny kid. 
                "He's just this lost soul I don't think he's a bad kid, he just got mixed in the wrong crowd." 
                Paul elaborated on the character's background, saying, "He doesn't come from an abusive, alcoholic background. 
                But maybe he just didn't relate to his father, maybe his father was too strict and too proper for Jesse." 
            </li>


            <li> Dean Norris as Hank Schrader, Marie's husband, Walter and Skyler's brother-in-law and a DEA agent. 
                At the beginning of the series, Hank was intended to be the "comic relief".  
            </li>


            <li> Betsy Brandt as Marie Schrader, Skyler's sister and Hank's kleptomaniac wife. 
                Brandt described Marie as "an unpleasant bitch", but also stated there was more to her than that. 
                "I think we're seeing more of it now that she would be there for her family. But it's all about her."
            </li>


            <li> RJ Mitte as Walter White, Jr., Walter and Skyler's son, who has cerebral palsy. 
                He begins lashing out after Walter's cancer announcement. Like Walter Jr., Mitte has cerebral palsy, although his is a milder form.
                Mitte stated he had to regress from his therapy to portray the character, staying up late into the night to slur his speech
                and learning to walk on crutches so his walking would not look fake.

        <h2> User Reviews </h2>
        <p> I have never watched a show that is as consistently genuine and engaging as Breaking Bad. This is undoubtedly one of the greatest shows ever, and it consistently improves as it progresses.

            The Journeys of Walter White and Jesse Pinkman are unforgettable. These are some of the best-written characters to ever come from a pen-hitting paper.
            
            My praises for the acting and cinematography are unending. Some of the shots are intricate works of art, and I was rarely distracted by the acting. The performances are excellent to the extent that it feels improper to refer to them as performances.
            
            Overall, Breaking Bad consistently maintains a level of engagement and technical quality seen in only the best of movies, and in terms of tone, every intense moment is executed with excellence and always achieves the impact it reaches for.
            
            I feel like the show's plot in the early seasons lacks a certain level of complexity due to it not having a vast amount of plot threads, and the start is a bit slow-paced, but Breaking Bad is an absolute must-watch. If you have mixed feelings towards Season 1, trust me, it is only uphill from there.
            
            If there was ever a series you could call perfect, I think this might be it. </p>

        <p> Breaking Bad is absolutely, without a doubt, one of the greatest tv shows ever created...it's damn near perfect! I know that people say that about a ton of different shows but Breaking Bad really is universally thought of as one of the greatest shows of all-time. All you have to do is go google "greatest tv shows of all-time" and I guarantee you that it's at or near the top of every list you'll find and there's a reason for that...because it is! Every season is just as brilliant as the others, which everyone knows is almost impossible for a show to do but one which Breaking Bad absolutely pulls off!! If you're one of the few people who still haven't seen this amazing show then do yourself a favor and go watch this immediately...you will not be disappointed! </p>
